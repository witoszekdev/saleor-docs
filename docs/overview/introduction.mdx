## What is Saleor?

[Saleor](https://saleor.io) is an e-commerce platform for building online stores. Create great-looking client interfaces with all the features that provide modern, rich shopping experiences. Use an administration dashboard to manage products, people, and functionalities easily. Saleor has solutions for small, midsize, and enterprise-level retailers and covers both physical and digital inventory.

One significant advantage of Saleor is that it is available as both a typical online store and as a PWA application. PWA means customers can download your store to any device and browse it offline. They can also make orders and payments just like when shopping online.

Saleorâ€™s open-source platform is free to use. It consists of Python GraphQL API and several TypeScript apps. The following documentation will cover all the services in detail.
